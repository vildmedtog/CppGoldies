Is available as a make version and a verion for MS VS-studio

There are two code samples of serializing objects 001 which is just getting a grib on how to serializing 
(GOF template method pattern)
and
002 which extends the sample with object factory (GOF factory method pattern)

The code is just for inspriration.

Good luck
